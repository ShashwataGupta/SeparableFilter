# SeparableFilter
This repo contains the C++ implementation of a Linearly Separable Filter:

Problem statement :- Create a solution whr you take fx and fy as filter co-efficients. The size of the filter is 31(radius being 15). 

1)	Input is an image with size varying from 64x64 to 1920x1920.
2)	Fx and fy each value can be from 0 to 1024. The sum of all the co-efficients is going to be less than 4096 and always pto the power of 2(like,2,4,8,16,32..etc)
3)	Output of always as 16 bit.
